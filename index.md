## Collective Play by Mimi Yin

Existentialism is the model (how you interact with other people) of collective play games we are going to make. 

Existentialism is: Individual Morality, Choices(in relation to other individuals), Chaos (purpose is unknowable/ Absurd paradoxical), Naval-gazing (obsessed with oneself). Inevitability of suffering and choice. Authenticity (Own reasons to be.


### Homework - Involve one other person to write about a absurd situation

At the Dubai Rugby 7's tournament me and my fellow team players were done with the games and after a brief rest we became spectators in the stadium for the platinum cup finals. This was the time when customarily many teams at the tournament dressed up as mascots. A team from England dressed up as babies wearing giant diapers. Another team dressed up as Stoneage Fintstones and so on and so forth. We too were about to take off our game uniforms and get into our costumes but before that we decided to  join the crowd in our game outfits. While we were watching the game a host of funny and absurd events followed. A normal sevens match consists of two halves of seven minutes with a two-minute half-time break. The entire stadium was a 2 minute party every 7 minutes, a lot of people got drunk. A girl standing a couple of aisles in front of us was standing with her boyfriend, she looked back and suddenly started pointing towards our team. Her boyfriend was busy watching the game. I pointed towards my teammate and asked her with hand gestures whether she was pointing towards him, but she responded with a head gesture saying "no", however she kept on pointing towards us with her arms and fingers for some odd reason.  As soon as the games 7 minutes were over, the music started, and she left her boyfriend, took strides up towards us, walked straight into me and attempted to kiss and said you have beautiful eyes. I was glad her boyfriend did not look at us, I said thank you. 

This wasn't the only awkward and absurd thing,soon afterwards another girl asked me to take my shirt off because it had her name on it, and she wanted to exchange it with hers.  The name of the sponsors matched her name. 

And when were walking down the stairs and a kid walked to me and handed over a rugby football and pen. And looked at me. I was very confused at to why he'd offer me a ball. So I gave him his pen back, and he refused to take it back, at this point my friend told me he wants your autograph. Momentarily i felt happy and found it absurd that I had a fan. So i signed the football and he was a happy kid.
